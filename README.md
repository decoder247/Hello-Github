Summary of lessons learned:
  - **Git vs Hub**: Git is the actual version control software (VCS). Github is the web service using Git hosted on servers. People can use github/git only without interchanging.
  - **Push vs pull**: In git, pushing is to put updates onto the 'remote' github, pulling is to get updates from the remote. In Github, there are only pull requests, refering to merging changes of 2 branches.
  - **Purpose of Git**: Version control + collaboration for docs.
  - **Visualise timeline**: Graphs tab -> Network. Visualises branches.
  - **Contribute to projects**: Fork from open source project -> Clone -> Commit -> Git Push -> on GH can make pull request to original project page.
  - **Merging**: Pull-request is the request to change, merge is the actual action
  - **Pull-request page**: Can see commits, changes & conversatdion
  - **Issues page**: Use the issues tab to list comments on issues. Specific commits can be referenced by PASTING commit hash identifier into the comments and it will automatically be attached to the issue.
  - **Issue/Commit Titles**: If in the title of the commit, a specific issue number (i.e. 'blabla #10') is referenced, the issue will be attached to the commit as being addressed. The keyword 'fix' or 'fixed' can be added to title as well with number to automatically close issue.
  - **Local Repo Creation**: Use 'git init' in selected work folder to set as repo.
  - **Local to GitHub migration**: To push changes from an offline created repo, first create the repo on github w/o readme, then add remote, and push changes.
  - **Existing to New GitHub remote upload**: To upload to a new Github repo from an existing local project (i.e. cloned from another repo):
    1. Rename original remote from source:
       - *git remote rename origin upstream*
    2. Add in new destination remote:
       - *git remote add origin NEW_GH_URL*
    3. Push as usual:
       - *git push origin master*
    4. Pull in patches from upstream:
       - *git pull upstream master && git push origin master*
  - **GitHub pages**: change master into "gh-pages" and set as default under settings. Can be accesed via the link listed on the guthub pages section in settings. Create an index.html file as the default page accessed in the website.
  - **Git remote**: pull changes to branch, commit changes, checkout to master and merge branch, push changes to remote
  - **.gitignore**: List files/folders for git not to track (Separated by line - e.g. log.txt, /dir2). Usually applies to node modules and log files. Can use **vs code plugin** to generate defaults for environment quickly.
  - **Branch switching**: Every time switch branch, the current directory will reflect files of branch.
  - **Commit messages**: Use emojis in titles to get GH stars. Can be multi-line in terminal such that the preceding lines is the comment and 1st line is the title.
