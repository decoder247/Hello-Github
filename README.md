Summary of lessons learned:
  - A pull request is a request to potentially merge made changes from another branch to (commonly) the master
  - Git is the actual version control software (VCS). Github is the web service using Git hosted on servers.
  - People can use github only and git only without interchanging.
  - Git -> Version control and collaboration for documents/code.
  - Visualise branches under graphs tab -> network
  - Post-forking, can make pull request to original project page
  - Pull-request is the request to change, merge is the actual action
  - Pull-request page can see commits, changes & conversation

Progress:
- Watched a few vids
- installed github for windows
