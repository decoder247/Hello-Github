Useful git commands:
  - git clone https://.....git
  - git status (has to be in the file) - to view changes
  - git commit -a -m "asdasdads"
    - if error follow msg to attach ur username + e-mail as authoer
  - git config --list
  - git log - shows commit history
  - IN git, pushing is to put updates onto the 'remote' or cloud github, pulling is to get updates from the remote
  - git remote -v  - v stands for verbose. Command is used to know what name of remote to push to.
  - git push origin master    - this pushes it to remote 'origin' and branch 'master'
  

Summary of lessons learned:
  - A pull request is a request to potentially merge made changes from another branch to (commonly) the master
  - Git is the actual version control software (VCS). Github is the web service using Git hosted on servers.
  - People can use github only and git only without interchanging.
  - Git -> Version control and collaboration for documents/code.
  - Visualise branches under graphs tab -> network
  - Post-forking, can make pull request to original project page
  - Pull-request is the request to change, merge is the actual action
  - Pull-request page can see commits, changes & conversation
  - Use the issues tab to list comments on issues. Specific commits can be referenced by PASTING commit hash identifier into the comments and it will automatically be attached to the issue.
  - If in the title of the commit, a specific issue number (i.e. 'blabla #10') is referenced, the issue will be attached to the commit as being addressed. The keyword 'fix' or 'fixed' can be added to title as well with number to automatically close issue.

Progress:
- Watched a few vids
- installed github for windows
